Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!\nNa na na, na na na, na na, na nah\n(Ooh)\nOh no, no no\nI'm gonna make a change\nIt's gonna feel real good!\nCome on!\n(Change)\nJust lift yourself\nYou know\nYou've got to stop it,\nYourself!\n(Yeah! Make that change!)\nI've got to make that change, today!\nHoo!\n(Man in the mirror)\nYou got to\nYou got to not let yourself\nBrother\nHoo!\n(Yeah! Make that change!)\nYou know I've got to get\nThat man, that man\nYou've got to\nYou've got to move! Come on!\nCome on!\nYou got to\nStand up! Stand up! Stand up!\n(Yeah! Make that change)\nStand up and lift yourself, now!\n(Man in the mirror)\nHoo! Hoo! Hoo!\nAw!\n(Yeah! Make that change!)\nGonna make that change\nCome on!\nYou know it!\nYou know it!\nYou know it!\nYou know it\n(Change)\nMake that change."
