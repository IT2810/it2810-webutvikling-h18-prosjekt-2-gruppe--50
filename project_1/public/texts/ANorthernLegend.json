	"text": "There sits a lovely maiden,\nThe ocean murmuring nigh;\nShe throws the hook, and watches;\nThe fishes pass it by.\n\nA ring, with a red jewel,\nIs sparkling on her hand;\nUpon the hook she binds it,\nAnd flings it from the land.\n\nUprises from the water\nA hand like ivory fair.\nWhat gleams upon its finger?\nThe golden ring is there.\n\nUprises from the bottom\nA young and handsome knight;\nIn golden scales he rises,\nThat glitter in the light.\n\nThe maid is pale with terror--\n'Nay, Knight of Ocean, nay,\nIt was not thee I wanted;\nLet go the ring, I pray.'\n\n'Ah, maiden, not to fishes\nThe bait of gold is thrown;\nThe ring shall never leave me,\nAnd thou must be my own.'"
